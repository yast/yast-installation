\chapter{YaST2.Second-Stage}

The YaST2.Second-Stage script is called via \textbf{/etc/init.d/boot}
and is used to finish the installation process. It will call YaST2
in the so called \textit{continue} mode. The script itself is called
from a installed system environment.

\section{Second-Stage Hooks}
The following Second-Stage hook directories are checked:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\underline{preSecondStage}}\\
	Within the installed system each script stored in the preSecondStage
	directory is called directly in front of the YaST2.Second-Stage script
\item \textbf{\underline{postSecondStage}}\\
	Within the installed system each script stored in the postSecondStage
	directory is called directly after the YaST2.Second-Stage script has
	been finished
\end{itemize}
