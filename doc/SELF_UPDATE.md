# Installer Self-update

Starting on version 3.1.175, yast2-install is able to update itself during
system installation. This feature will help to solve problems with the
installation even after the media has been released. Check
[FATE#319716](https://fate.suse.com/319716) for a more in-depth rationale.

## Disabling Updates

Self-update is enabled by default. However, it can be disabled by setting
`self_update=0` boot option.

## Basic Workflow

These are the basic steps performed by YaST in order to perform the update:

1. During installation, YaST will look automatically for a rpm-md repository
   containing the updates.
2. If updates are available, they will be downloaded. Otherwise, the process
   will be silently skipped.
3. The update will be applied to the installation system.
4. YaST will be restarted and the installation will be resumed.

## Update Format

YaST will use RPM packages stored in a rpm-md repository, although they are
handled in a different way:

* All RPMs in the repository are considered (no "patch" metadata).
* RPMs are not installed in the usual way: they're uncompressed and no scripts
  are executed.
* No dependency checks are performed. RPMs are added in alphabetical order.

## Where to Find the Updates

The URL of the update repository is evaluated in this order:

1. The `SelfUpdate` boot option
2. The AutoYaST control file - in AutoYaST installation only, use the
   `/general/self_update_url` XML node:

   ```xml
   <general>
     <self_update_url>http://example.com/updates/$arch</self_update_url>
   </general>
   ```
3. Hard-coded in the `control.xml` file on the installation medium (thus it
   depends on the base product):

   ```xml
   <globals>
     <self_update_url>http://updates.suse.com/sle12/$arch</self_update_url>
   </globals>
   ```

The first found option is used. If no update URL is found then the self update
is skipped.

The URL can contain a variable `$arch` that will be replaced by the system's
architecture, such as `x86_64`, `s390x`, etc. You can find more information
in the [Arch module](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-yast2/Yast/ArchClass).

## Security

Updates signatures will be checked by libzypp. If the signature is not
correct (or is missing), the user will be asked whether she/he wants to apply
the update (although it's a security risk).

## Self-update and User Updates

Changes introduced by the user via Driver Updates (`dud` boot option) will take
precedence. As you may know, user driver updates are applied first (before the
self-update is performed).

However, the user changes will be re-applied on top of the installer updates.
