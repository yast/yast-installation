Deploying Images
================

* Improve deploying user-feedback
    - Untar images using .process agent with along with tar option --checkpoint
    - Add <size> tag to images to predict a better progress layout
    - Enable [Abort] functionality

* Improve deploying speed and memory consumption
    - Try to optimize the tar archive
    - In case of low memory, use disk instead of memory to download an image

* Bugs?
    - Fix metadata image (seems not to be used anymore or ignored?)

* Missig documentation
    - Some new tags in control file
    - Document images.xml format

* Installation proposal/overview
    - Provide a possibility to select another imageset or to ignore
      images completely

Automatic Configuration
=======================

* Progress
    - Currently uses only one progress for all actions. Use that one progress
      plus use one another with 0-100% for every single proposal or
      set of scripts.

General
=======

* Have a lot of fun! :) ;)
