module Installation
  # Class to handle unmounting all mounts from the given subtree on in the
  # right order.
  #
  # This uses /proc/mounts by default to find active mounts, but for
  # testability, it can also be fed from other files or line by line. It stores
  # all necessary unmount actions so they can be executed all at once, and they
  # can also be inspected without the execute step. This is intended for
  # logging, debugging and testing.
  #
  # This relies on /proc/mounts already containing the entries in canonical
  # order (which it always does), i.e. in the mount hierarchy from top to
  # bottom. If you add entries manually, make sure to maintain that order.
  #
  # Sample usage:
  #
  #   unmounter = Installation::Unmounter.new("/mnt")
  #   log.info("Paths to unmount: #{unmounter.unmount_paths}")
  #   unmounter.execute
  #
  # Without specifying a file to read as the second parameter in the
  # constructor, it will default to /proc/mounts which is the right thing for
  # real life use.

    # This iterates over all relevant mounts and invokes the external "umount"
    # command for each one separately. Notice that while "umount -R path" also
    # exists, it will stop executing when it first encounters any mount that
    # cannot be unmounted ("filesystem busy"), even if mounts that come after
    # that could safely be unmounted.
    #
    # If unmounting a mount fails, this does not attempt to remount read-only
    # ("umount -r"), by force ("umount -f") or lazily ("umount -l"):
    #
    # - Remounting read-only ("umount -r" or "mount -o remount,ro") typically
    #   also fails if unmounting fails. It would have to be a rare coincidence
    #   that a filesystem has only open files in read-only mode already; only
    #   then it would have a chance to succeed.
    #
    # - Force-unmounting ("umount -f") realistically only works for NFS mounts.
    #   It is intended for cases when the NFS server has become unreachable.
    #
    # - Lazy unmounting ("umount -l") mostly removes the entry for this
    #   filesytem from /proc/mounts; it actually only unmounts when the pending
    #   operations that prevent a simple unmount are finished which may take a
    #   long time; or forever. And there is no way to find out if or when this
    #   has ever happened, so the next mount for this filesystem may fail.
