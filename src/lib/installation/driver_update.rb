module Installation
  # Represents a driver update.
  #
  # This class will handle driver updates which are applied yet.
  # The main purpose is to re-apply them after the installer's
  # self-update has been performed.
  #
  # At this point, two kinds of driver updates are considered:
  #
  # * Driver Update Disks (DUD): a directory containing different
  #   subdirectories, one of them called inst-sys.
  # * Packages: are stored in a squashed filesystem which is mounted
  #   in /mounts directory.
