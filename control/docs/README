    For the various products starting from SuSE Linux 9.1, several product
    control  packages have been created and more will follow for future
    products. Those special package are used when creating the CDs and they
    install the control file into the first CD of the product.

    Any modification to the control file in the CVS tree of YaST wont
    appear in the respective products. Such changes have to be done in the
      following packages instead:

    - skelcd-control-SLD
    - skelcd-control-SLES
    - skelcd-control-SUSELinux-Prof
    - skelcd-control-SUSELinux-Pers
