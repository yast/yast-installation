Products:
---------
    For the various products starting from SuSE Linux 9.1, several product
    control  packages have been created and more will follow for future
    products. Those special package are used when creating the CDs and they
    install the control file into the first CD of the product.

    Any modification to the control file in the YaST Git tree will not
    appear in the respective products. Such changes have to be done in the
      following packages instead:

    - skelcd-control-SLD
    - skelcd-control-SLES
    - skelcd-control-openSUSE

Add-On Products:
----------------
    - add-on-template_installation
    
    This file is a template for adding a workflow to the
    Language Add-On Product. It should be saved under the root directory
    of the add-on product as 'installation.xml'.

    Currently it uses these clients
	* inst_language_add-on
	* inst_rpmcopy (inside inst_language_add-on)

Control file validation:
------------------------
trang control.rnc control.rng && xmllint --noout --relaxng control.rng ${XML_FILE}
